Convolutional Neural Network

----DESCRIPTION----

This program implements a convolutional neural network in order to sort 2 types
of Corgis. The file cnn.py handles the neural network while dataset.py handles the
retrieval and importing of the training and testing data sets.

In order to run the program, execute the cnn.py file with the dataset.py and data folder
in the same file location. The required modules are PyTorch, OpenCV, OS, Glob, Sklearn,
and NumPy. The program was written and tested in the Spyder IDE provided by Python Anaconda 3.7.
